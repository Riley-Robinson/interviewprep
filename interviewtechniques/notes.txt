Either:
* Something you already wrote
* something you have to write on the spot

rules of interviewing
Relax - harddest thing to do

i pretend i already have a job 
and the interviewer is a coeworker that is coming to me for help.

puts you in a helping/teacher mindset.

shows off how you can work in a perfessional setting

Changes Things to be a bit more "cooperative"
    Employers love teamwork

Dont be afraid to explore the problem
    think out loud

the the problem to the interviewer
-------------------------------------------------
UPER



understand:
Explaine the problem to the interviewer
    in your own worlds

Plan:
    If you already wrote the code:
        Compare multiple soulutons that you came up with
    Else:
        Come up with multiple soulutons
